# FFCTextField

FFCTextField is a small collection of features for implementing
elegane text fields suitable for use in forms, and elsewhere.

The text field's placeholder text animates into a floating title
label.

The text field also features validation functions that provide
feedback to the user via the same floating label mechanism.
